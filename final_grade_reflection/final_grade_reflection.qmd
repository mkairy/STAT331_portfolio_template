Through my work in this class so far, I believe I have earned an A.

This quarter, I turned in most all of my assignments complete and on time, and all of the assignments I have turned in demonstrate my proficiency in the learning targets. 

WD-1 can be seen in Data Import Practice

WD-2 is in Lab 3 Q10

WD-3 is shown in Lab 3 Q9 and Q10

WD-4 is in Lab 3 Q4

WD-5 and WD-6 is in Challenge 4 Q3

WD-7 is in Challenge 4 Q3

R-1 and R-2 is in Lab 2

R-3 is in Lab 3 Q7 and Lab 7 Task 5

DVS-1 is in Lab 2 Q4, Lab 2 Q8, and Lab 3 Q8

DVS-2 is in Lab 4 Q7

DVS-3 is in Lab 4 Q7 and Challenge 2 Q10

DVS-4 is in Lab 3 problem 7

DVS-5 is in Lab 3 problem 7 and Lab 7 Part 1 Task 1

DVS-6 is in Challenge 9 Part 5 Q2 & Q3

DVS-7 is in Challenge 9 Part 5 Q3

PE-1 is in Lab 3 Q10

PE-2 is in Lab 7 Part 2 Task 1 & 2

PE-3 is in Challenge 8 Q3

PE-4 is in Challenge 4 Q3

DSM-1 is in Practice Activity 9 Q2 & Q3

DSM-2 is in Lab 9 Part 4 Q4

I've only been able to meet all of these learning requirements because I have taken every opportunity to revise my work and learn from it. In Lab 3 question 1, I got a "G" on my description of the data set, where I left out much of the important information about how and where the data was collected. After revising this question in Lab 3, I answered question 1 in Lab 4 to include as much relevant information about the data as possible. In addition to simply learning from my revisions in future labs, I have also revised assignments using techniques we learned later on in the course. In my Challenge 4 Q5 assignment, I originally made three different visualizations for my avocado sales, avocado prices, and house prices from 2015 to 2018. I realized in my revision that to combine the three variables into one plot to effectively show the relationship between them, I needed to re-scale the data. To do so, I used a function we wrote in week 7. I was proud of how I\'d been able to independently identify a use for the new function, while making a plot that I just couldn\'t seem to get right look great.

Beyond revising the work I've already done, I always find opportunities to try out new functions, techniques, or edits to my HTML. In my Challenge 2 and Challenge 8 assignments, I took the time to complete all of the challenges. In Challenge 2, coming from my experience writing highly inefficient R code, I wanted to extend my thinking by working on efficiency, specifically in using the fewest function calls necessary. I was most proud of how I chose to annotate my plot in Q10, where I used one annotate call with x and y ranges and a list, instead of using several annotate arguments. In challenge 8 Q3, I was most proud of how I used regular expressions to add commas and new lines to my output, only if punctuation didn\'t end the line. I used a preceded by alpha expression to achieve this, which required me to use many of the stringr and regular expression techniques we learned. Perhaps what I am most proud of, though, is my Challenge 4 Q3 submission, where I used data from FRED that required me to use just about every data cleaning technique we\'d learned at that point to create a unified, clean data set.

Aside from making sure my assignments are quality work, I help my group members do the same in each class. To effectively contribute to my group, I am always present in class (not missing a single class), and I come prepared, having done the preview activities (almost always on time), videos, and reading. Because I come with some knowledge of the problems we will be asked, I have been able to answer most of my group members' questions, along with helping to troubleshoot any errors or weird output. I also make myself readily available over text, answering questions outside of class when anyone in the group needs help.

Outside of my group, I help other students by putting time into my peer reviews. Even when one of my peers' lab looks almost perfect, I try to find some areas that could make their code easier to read or just offer a creative way to solve a problem. My review in peer_review.png shows how I praised the lab work, but still offered suggestions on the tidy and efficient criteria. Additionally, my peer reviews are specific. In peer_review_2.png, I praise the general tidiness of the code and specific functions that I admired.
